**Code 401 - Advanced Software Development**

*Class 01 Reading*

**Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?**
- Running JavaScript outside a browser means you are using node. js to execute your JavaScript code - this allows us to use JavaScript without using an HTML page to run functions. 

**What is the difference between a module and a package?**
- A package is an extension of a module - while a module is a single JavaScript file that needs to be called in another file, a package is a directory containing complex chunks of code that can be shared with other developers.

**What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?**
- By planning out the input format & expected outputs before development,  it can help prevent uncertainty during the process & create almost a set of guiding principles while writing code.

**What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?**
- If we're not starting from scratch, I can see this being difficult to write for legacy code. Also, maintenance as the codebase changes.

**What does the node package manager do?**
- It allows us to use packages created and shared by independent developers




*Class 02 Reading*

**What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?**
- You can change the type on the fly, as needed.

**What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type?**
- You can get into situations where your variable is not containing the type of data that it should. These kinds of errors can become very hard to track and solve in large code bases.

**Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?**
- Depends on the situation, if we're able to change parameters, we can re-use functions to do different tasks.

**Describe a type of data that has rules, aside from the given examples of Number, Integer and Float. What are the rules the data should follow?**
- A boolean, which represents only one of two values: true or false.
