*Class 01 Reading*

**Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?**
- Running JavaScript outside a browser means you are using node. js to execute your JavaScript code - this allows us to use JavaScript without using an HTML page to run functions. 

**What is the difference between a module and a package?**
- A package is an extension of a module - while a module is a single JavaScript file that needs to be called in another file, a package is a directory containing complex chunks of code that can be shared with other developers.

**What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?**
- By planning out the input format & expected outputs before development,  it can help prevent uncertainty during the process & create almost a set of guiding principles while writing code.

**What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?**
- If we're not starting from scratch, I can see this being difficult to write for legacy code. Also, maintenance as the codebase changes.

**What does the node package manager do?**
- It allows us to use packages created and shared by independent developers
